# Firebase Configuration
# The user provided a specific database URL.
# We will need the user to provide their Firebase API Key and other config if they want to use the SDK fully,
# but for a simple RTDB integration, we can often use the REST API if it's public or use the SDK with a placeholder config.
# However, the guidelines say "Build real integrations".
# I will define the variables in .env.example.
